## Old Uptrends situation

![old situation](https://github.com/Barsonax/CI-Improvements/raw/master/images/old_situation.png)

- ~65 min to finish

--

## Old Infra situation

![old infra situation](https://github.com/Barsonax/CI-Improvements/raw/master/images/infra_old_situation.png)

- ~50 min to finish

--

## How did it feel to maintain?

<!-- .slide: data-background="https://github.com/Barsonax/CI-Improvements/raw/master/images/minefield2.gif" -->

--

## Why

- No branching
- Continue after errors
- Missing logging
- Hidden dependencies between steps
- Logic scattered throughout TeamCity

--

## How can we solve this?

## Current Uptrends situation

![new situation](https://github.com/Barsonax/CI-Improvements/raw/master/images/new_situation.png)

- ~36 min to finish (44.6% faster)

--

## Current Infra situation

![new situation](https://github.com/Barsonax/CI-Improvements/raw/master/images/infra_new_situation.png)

- ~28 min to finish (44% faster)

--

## Downtrend build duration

--

## Why so much focus on the build?

- Core feedback loop
- Humans are bad multitaskers
- Productive developers are happy developers

--

## Not just faster

- Logic in NUKE build (C#)
- Branching
- Fail fast
- Better logging
- More isolation
- Build reuse

--

## Nuke build

- Build automation tool
- C# console project 
- full IDE and debugging support.
- Target dependency model
- <https://www.nuke.build/>

```csharp
    Target MyTarget => _ => _
        .Executes(() =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello!");
        });
```

--

## Uptrends build example

```csharp
    Target Uptrends4Build => _ => _
        .DependsOn(
            NugetAuthenticate,
            Uptrends4CopyPatchConfigs,
            Uptrends4FrontendBuild,
            Uptrends4BackendBuild,
            UptrendsCreateNuGetPackages,
            UptrendsPushOctopusPackages,
            ErrorCodeDocumentationExport,
            ReviewUntranslatedTexts
        );
--

## Logging

- Command invocations with parameters
  - By default in NUKE build
- Some build steps were changed to add additional logging

![logging](https://github.com/Barsonax/CI-Improvements/raw/master/images/Logging.png)

--

## Split up build

- Parallel builds on multiple machines.
- Better isolation 
  - e.g. octopus is down unit tests are still executed
- Faster feedback

--

## Build reuse

- Runs only when sources of snapshot changed
  
![reusebuilds](https://github.com/Barsonax/CI-Improvements/raw/master/images/ReuseBuilds.png)

--

## Checkout rules

- Is not a trigger rule
- Allows for checking out part of the repository
- Affects snapshots -> Build reuse

![checkoutrules](https://github.com/Barsonax/CI-Improvements/raw/master/images/CheckkoutRules.png)

--

## Other improvements

- Packagereferences
- Binding redirects
- NET sdk projects
- Faster local feedback loop
- Test projects naming convention

---

## Future Improvements

- Nuke all the builds
- Further separate builds
- Use artifact dependencies
- Run zoo tests in Docker

--

## Further separate builds

- Increase parallelism
- More effective use of checkout rules

--

## Use artifact dependencies

- Prevent redundant builds

--

## Run zoo tests with Docker

- Run SQL container with Docker
- Horizontal scaling
- DB on a `tmpfs` mount to eliminate the disk bottleneck
- Zoo tests run on local container instead of the `NUKA`
